# FloatingForYoutube
A couple of shorts AUTOIT-scripts to find the "Floating for YouTube"-window and interact with it.

I have bound each script to a button on my mouse (using X-Mouse Button Control) for ease-of-use

## Pause.au3
Finds the "Floating for YouTube"-window, pauses the video, unpins it from "Always on top" and minimizes the window

## Play.au3
Finds the "Floating for YouTube"-window, restores it from minimized, pins it on "Always on top" and then presses play
